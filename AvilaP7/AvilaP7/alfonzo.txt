Energy Production Analysis

*Introduction*
The data file was obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The data contains the primary energy production by source beginning from
1949 to 2014 in quadrillion BTU (British thermal unit).The only pieces of 
data being analyzed are the total renewable energy production and the
overall total energy production. Renewable energy production is energy
sourced from hydroelectric power, geothermal, solar/photovoltaic, wind and
biomass. Below is the URL address of the data source.

*Data Analysis Question #1*
How much has renewable energy production grown since 1949?

In 1949, 2.97 quadrillion BTUs (British thermal unit) of renewable energy
was produced in the U.S. It's important to note that certain renewable
energy was not available yet such as geothermal, solar, and wind energy.
As of 2014, renewable energy production grew 224.7% since 1949.


*Data Analysis Question #2*
How much renewable and overall total energy has been produced since 1949?

Total Renewable Energy Produced(1949-2014)	342 quadrillion BTU
Total Overall Energy Produced(1949-2014)	4060 quadrillion BTU


*Data Analysis Question #3*
What are the decade averages for both renewable energy produced
and total overall energy produced?

Decade		Average Renewable	Average Overall
		Energy			Energy
50's		2.88			39.47
60's		3.37			50.65
70's		4.56			62.99
80's		5.93			67.42
90's		6.36			71.08
2000's		6.32			71.14
The averages are in quadrillion BTU (British thermal unit).
