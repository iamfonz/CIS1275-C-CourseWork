# CIS1275- C++ Coursework
This repository contains all of the assignments from my very first programming class taken at [Central New Mexico Community College](https://www.cnm.edu/).

The course is what got me started in programming. I immediately loved programming after taking this course. It set the path for me to begin my coding journey.

Unfortunately I lost a few of my first programs because I was in the process of buying a new PC for development. And at that time I was just transferring things via USB to different virtual machines on campus. Unfortunately, I lost those first few programs.

Thanks for checking it out! :D
